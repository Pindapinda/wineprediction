                                During the last decades, the world of experts has started to tremble, from wine quality prediction to assessing baseball players. The ability of human experts to make accurate predictions and assessments largely  based on intuition, experience and debatable practical rules is being put to question. Although everyone would expect that using data and mathematical models to generate insights about the future is associated only with the modern era. One of the first reported stories of using scientific methods instead of intuition to predict the future price of a commodity, is actually reported approximately 2.5 millennia ago. Thales of Miletus, a pre- Socratic Philosopher, mathematician and astronomer. Who lived during the 6th century BC is, according to an ancient story one of the first people to use weather predictions to predict olive oil production. The story goes that Thales, by observing the weather, was able to predict that the next olive harvest would be particularly good. He subsequently either bought a large amount of land for a substantially lower price. Or reserved  most of the olive presses in advance, thus being able to charge more for the service of renting them. What is though the most interesting fact of this story, is that Thales didn’t do it for profiting, but to prove to his peers that science was much more than a silly hobby. As it used to be regarded back then.
                            </p>
                                
<p style="padding-left:1cm">
    This event marks one of the first known attempts to approach business in a systematic and scientific way, in other words the rise of the first data crunchers! A lot has changed since the age of Thales. Surprisingly though, it was only a few years ago, that someone tried to make predictions about the price and quality of  another popular product of the ancient times: Wine! Orley Ashenfelter in the late 1980’s did the unthinkable. He proved that wine experts, who were supposed to be the absolute authority of everything regarding wine, could be outperformed by a single linear model of a few variables. Below you will find everything regarding Orley’s case and legacy; how he made his predictions, what is happening on the field right now and how he transformed the field of wine price and quality prediction.

								<h2 class="mu-title">The birth of quantitative wine analysis</h2>
								<span class="mu-title-dot"></span>

								<p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">In the late eighties Orley Ashenfelter, professor in Economics at Princeton University, shocked wine connoisseurs, investors and oenologists<sup>*</sup> alike, by announcing that he could predict the quality of a wine several years before it is ready to drink. Ashenfelter wanted a reliably way to find good ones that fit in his budget, which required that he outperform the current system: Traditionally wine tasters would wait until four months after the wine has been placed in a barrel and then start to taste the mixture, long before it has developed it's final taste. Using their experience wine tasters would then try to predict whether the wine would ultimately taste well. This has proven to be a difficult process, as confirmed by Bruce Kaiser, the former director of wine auctioneering at Butterfield & Butterfield who has said that: "Young wines are changing so quickly that no one, and I mean no one, can really evaluate a vintage at all accurately by taste until it is at least ten years old, perhaps older." So when Ashenfelter announced that he could do what professional tasters couldn't based solely on some weather information the established order of wine specialists was sceptical to say the least.

                                In his paper which he <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2008.02148.x">republished</a> in 2008 Ashenfelter investigates five factors that he thinks could affect Bordeaux wine prices. Because young Bordeaux wines are more astringent many people prefer to drink these wines after they have aged a bit, meaning that wines are traded when they are young and sold for more once they are older. In the end Ashenfelter settled on using three weather-related variables, in addition to the age of the wine, which allows him to explain approximately 83% of all variation in the average price of Bordeaux wine vintages. Below we show exactly what these variables are and how they matter, just click the buttons next to description to get a visualisation of the impact of different variables.

                                            Armed with the knowledge that these factors were in fact related to the price of wines years later, a simple <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com/regression">regression</a> can be used on the logarithm of the price which yields the following formula: $$Log(Price) = 0.0238*Age + 0.616*Temp - 0.00386*Rain_{\text(Aug-Sep)} + 0.00117*Rain_{\text(Oct-Mar)}$$. Compared to the old-fashioned way this method is incredibly simple, easy and, perhaps most importantly, it gives a competative edge when buying wines at a young age because it does not relies on actual tasting. It is probably because of these reasons that Ashenfelter's ideas have had such a major impact. 
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h3 class="mu-title">Impact and Critique</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            In 1986 Ashenfelter started publishing a newsletter called <a href="http://www.liquidasset.com/">Liquid Assets</a> and although it started small (~600 subscribers in 1990) it quickly got the attention of some of Americas leading wine critics after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/04/us/wine-equation-puts-some-noses-out-of-joint.html">publication</a> in the New York Times where Ashenfelter boldly claimed that the 1986 vintage, which critics had acclaimed as an outstanding wine in the making, was going to be mediocre at best and that the 1989 vintage, which was only three months into the aging process and hadn't been tasted yet, was going to be the best wine of the century! These claims prompted Robert M. Parker Jr., who was generally regarded as the most influential wine critic in America, to assert that Ashenfelter's predictions where "ludicrous and absurd" and other wine experts generally agreed that there was no merrit to these methods. History however shows that Ashenfelter's predictions where right on the mark and nowadays it seems that, although they are loath to admit it, the connoisseurs have also started taking the weather into account when they make their own predictions, which are very close to the ones obtained using the above formula as can also be deducted from one of the articles discussed <a>below</a> <!--TODO: insert link to relevant article -->.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In addition, the push towards quantification of wine price forecasting has given rise to an increase in other research and publications, some of which are described <a href="#mu-apps-screenshot">below</a>. Although Ashenfelter's newspaper no longer exists, he still maintains a <a href="http://www.liquidasset.com/">website</a> that is used by wine and super crunching enthousiasts to share insight into the process of applying data science to wine price prediction. There even exists now a <a href="https://www.wine-economics.org/journal/">journal of wine economics</a> as well as an associated <a href="https://www.wine-economics.org/"> association of wine economists.</a> Some caution however, is adviced as the price of wines is still heavily influenced by the ratings of tasters. This might in part be explained by the authority that human experts still hold, but there is also another explanation: there is no real/objective measure of quality when it comes to wine, as is described excellently in this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-10/how-to-judge-wine-without-tasting-it">article</a> by Peter Orszag. In the wine market, quality is subjective, especially when taking into account that research has <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-wine-economics/article/debunking-critics-wine-words-can-amateurs-distinguish-the-smell-of-asphalt-from-the-taste-of-cherries/1057FD7B4D7879CF901E87F7B3167E42">proven</a> that people are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1984.tb13686.x">unable</a> to judge wine quality. Given this lack of a objective quality measure the market of wine valuation is expected to remain a subject of experts as opposed to a matter of pure science and the influence these experts have on the market is so strong that their predictions sometimes become self-fulfilling prophesies, making it impossible for pure quantitative methods to prevail.

								<span class="mu-title-dot"></span>
								<p>Over the course of the last three decades, many new articles have been written that add to Ashenfelter's original work by using new ideas and/or techniques. Below is shown a small selection of a few of such articles presented chronologically to give an impression of the growth of the field.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="mu-feature-content">

                                    <p>
                                        In a 2001 paper by O. Ashenfelter and A.Corsi, the authors investigate this time the relationship between weather and expert rating.  Expert ratings are used as a proxy for wine quality as opposed to price, mainly due to the fact that good quality data on prices are not available for Italy. The weather variables used for the prediction are the same as the original Ashenfelter papers namely : total rainfalls (in millimeters) between October and March of the season preceding the vintage; the average monthly temperature (in degrees centigrade) March to July; total rainfalls in August and September; and the average temperature in the same months.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the expert ratings three sources of experts were used. For each expert a regression model is fitted using the experts ratings as targets and temperature and precipitation as features.  Consequently all models are compared between each other. The prediction results for all three experts show that the model is not performing as expected, and the ability to predict the expert ratings from weather data is limited. For this reason a number of tests is performed, to  ascertain whether the expert predictions are mutually independent, or whether there is some sort of common misperception between experts or maybe because the experts have access to some information which is not available to the researchers. In other words Ashenfelter argues that either the experts are wrong, as he consistently tries to prove in his work<sup>*</sup>. Or that they possess some additional information relative to what is widely available to the public. It is important to note here that these claims depend on the assumption that the weather model which was used for Bordeaux still holds for the Italian wines. Since wine price data which can corroborate this fact are unavailable.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Conclusions</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Ashenfelter and Corsi observe statistically relevant relation between weather data and expert reviews, although only for the amount of summer rainfalls. This  indicates that experts consider the amount of rain during the summer period to be of importance when making predictions themselves. Furthermore the analysis performed on some of the experts reviews, show a decreasing relation between predicted and observed ratings along time. A fact which is consistent with previous findings by Ashenfelter, which show that prices during the first years are either over or under estimated in comparison with the price of the older mature wine. This indicates that expert predictions tend not to be accurate in the years before a specific vintage has actually matured. It is shown that expert predictions are highly correlated, a fact which means that either there is some information’s unavailable to the public which is possessed by wine experts or that there is some common / mutual misperception among wine experts.

                                        <p>
                                            Introduction In their 2006 article “Spatial Variations in Climate and Bordeaux Wine Prices” Sébastien Lecocq, Michael Visser. Consider the importance of taking into account small-scale climate variations to predict wine quality and price. Using data from several local weather stations, as opposed to only one central station. The Bordeaux region is vast, with its vineyards spanning over 3000 square kilometers. It is not uncommon for vineyards to have a distance of more than 100 kilometers between each other. This considerable distance, between vineyards, means that there are different micro-climates affecting different parts of the Bordeaux region. Moreover the measurements considered by Ashenfelter are taken from a single meteorological station located only a few kilometers away from the city of Bordeaux, meaning that city heat and pollution, could affect the measurements. In order to ascertain the effects of the micro-climates on wine quality, the authors compare two models, one using measurements only from one central station and the other using measurements from 11 local stations. The variables used in both models are similar to the ones used by Ashenfelter. Namely  data on rainfall, temperature and the total number of days of frost. The time period considered is 1993 to 2002.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The importance of being able to determine the price and hence the quality of a specific wine, as in most articles price is assumed to be a good proxy for quality, stems from the fact that wines are sold approximately one to two  years before they are actually bottled. This fact makes it difficult or even impossible to determine the wine quality at the time the sale takes place. The dataset considered includes about 50% of the different Bordeaux appellations<sup>*</sup>. The data shows considerable variations in average precipitation, For instance, in the winter months (January-March), the average total rainfall is 165 mm in Pauillac and 208 mm in Cadaujac. Similarly, during early spring (April-May), it rains on average 133 mm in Lesparre-Médoc and 176mm in Mérignac. And inter-station variance in frost measurements. On the other hand the variation of average temperature is quite modest, with maximum variations ranging to slightly more than 1 degree Celsius.

                                        <h5>Results & Conclusion</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            The authors observe similar results for both models, namely the factors which most impact wine price are wet winters and dry springs and summers lead to significantly higher prices and thereby better wine quality; prices are also significantly higher when the months preceding harvest (August-September) are hot and the months preceding veraison (June-July) relatively cold. Although the model taking into account local weather stations performs better than the model of only a single station, the difference is not  that significant. It should though be noted that, the authors consider only the auction prices. Which take place almost 2 years before the wine is actually bottled, and not the final prices of the wine after it has matured. This fact may affect the results as Ashenfelter has shown that the auction prices are significantly different than the prices after the wine has matured. Finally interestingly it seems from the results of this article, that wine experts have started to incorporate Ashenfelter’s formula in their predictions. This can be observed specifically from the fact that there appears to be significant correlation between early prices, which are heavily dependent on expert valuations, and weather conditions. This corroborates the ”Supercrunchers” claim that experts started incorporated Ashenfelters formula, in their predictions.

                                        In their 2015 paper “Seasonal differences in climate in the Chianti region of Tuscany and the relationship to vintage wine quality” Salinger et. al. examine the co-relation between wine quality and weather conditions in the Chianti region of Italy. The key differences between Ashenfelters and their research are:
                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Salinger et al. obtain wine quality as a consensus using  different rating sources, as opposed to using price as a proxy for quality.</li>
                                        <li>the data used is much more granular, because it distinguishes between the main phenological phases of grapevine namely bud break, flowering, veraison and ripening and considering weather effects on each phase separately.</li>
                                        <li>Finally much more detailed weather data is used by including a combination of station observations and weather type (WT) analyses.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>  
                                        The authors use five different sources of wine reviews to determine groups of top and bottom ranked vintages, using data from the period 1980 to 2011. These reviews are used to identify the 8 best and worst years that produced the higher and lowest quality wines respectively. Salinger et. al.  also classify weather into 8 different types namely WT1 through WT8. In the figure the percentage frequency of the 8 weather types can be observed as well as the statistically significant relationships between consensus rankings and the mean values of the selected variables.
                                        A total of 8 different weather types are identified, an example of these types are WT1: Marked northward expansion of the Azores anticyclone with blocked anticyclonic circulation over the North Atlantic and northerly winds over Italy. WT2: Moderate northward expansion of the Azores anticyclone with cyclonic circulation over south Scandinavia

                                    <h5>Conclusions</h5>
                                    <p>The results are very much in line with Ashenfelter’s results, indicating that  best-quality vintages occur in warm and dry growing seasons, and inferior-quality vintages in cooler and wetter conditions. The difference in this article, is that additional insights are generated regarding the importance of climatic factors, during the different growth phases of the vines. The most important factors determining wine quality were found to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_degree-day">Growing Degree Days</a> (GDD), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huglin_index">Huglin Index</a> (HI), $T_{max}$, $T_{min}$, $T_{avg}$ and the number of days with temperature above 35 °C. Where GDD and HI are defined as:$$ GDD = \sum_{i=i}^{n}\max\bigg[\frac{(T_{max}-T_{min})}{2}-10°C, 0\bigg]$$ $$HI = \sum_i^n\max\bigg[ \frac{(T_{avg}-10°C)+(T_{max}-10°C)}{2}, 0\bigg]\times d$$ These parameters were shown to be important during spring and summer, with GDD being the most important factor during the ripening period. The only timeframe were moisture was significant was during varaison, with low precipitation days giving rise to better vinages. During the dormancy period, warmer and wetter winters resulted in  better quality vintages, while warmer and drier winters led to lower quality ones. The seasons which produced the better quality vintages were characterized by $T_{max}$ 2 °C and $T_{avg}$ 1.5 °C above average vintages. Interestingly weather types do not seem to directly affect vintage quality, but they do allow growers to anticipate weather conditions well ahead of time.</p>

                                                It is clear from the rest of this page that the interest in French wines goes far beyond the French borders. Between 2001 and 2011 the <a href="https://www.liv-ex.com/home.do">major fine wine indexes</a> which are based on the auction prices of fine wines tripled in value. Jean-Marie Cardebat and Linda Jiao from the university of Bordeaux show in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.qref.2017.07.016">their 2017 article</a> that the price of fine wines is cointegrated with the stock markets in Pacific Asia and especially with the Chinese stock market. In addition they find a causal relation where the economic growth in certain regions causes a direct increase in prices of specific wines. This is an interesting contribution because it challenges the hedonic assumption that the price of fine wine is based exclusively on it's taste and quality, which is something that e.g. Ashenfelter has to assume. Instead the paper shows that, much like any product that is actively traded, this price is also subjected to traditional market effects.

                                                Cardebat and Jiao use something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration_test">Cointegration Test</a> which is a statistical method that compares different time series and checks whether there is a statistically significant relation between them. In this case, the cointegration tests where used to compare fine wine prices with 25 different MSCI (Morgen Stanley Capital International) stock indexes. These indexes are chosen on four levels:

                                                Using the cointegration tests in combination with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality">Granger Causality Model</a> allows Cardebat and Jiao to find the causal effects that the different stock markets have on the fine wine price. Below we share some of their most interesting finds.

                                            As can be seen in figure <!--TODO: insert figure here--> there is a strong relation between the stock market MSCI indexes of Emerging markets <em>after</em> 200. This can be explained by the link between stock markets and an increase in household disposable income and the rise of the middle class. With this growth in wealth comes the pursuit for a more fashionable lifestyle, which includes expensive wines. In China, whose MSCI stock market index the experiment found to have the strongest effect on the fine wine index, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good">Veblen effect</a> causes people to look for fine wines as a reflection of wealth and social status. Combined with a <a href="http://www.oiv.int/en/databases-and-statistics/statistics">67% increase in wine consumption</a>, this explains the strong effect the growing Chinese economy has had on the fine wine price index.
